  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Restructure calls to GMP and MPFR API's so as to maintain computability
      with libgmp version 4.3.2 and libmpfr version 2.4.2, which ship with
      some supported versions of Linux.

    * Switch bitcoin internals to use arbitrary-precision rational numbers for
      internal financial calculations, using the GNU multi-precision numerics
      library.
    * Minor code cleanup and formatting fixes.

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta4~precise1) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Added a transaction-fee budget (currently empty) for possible future
      expansion. A Republicoin-like implementation for Bitcoin, for example,
      would assay taxes from the transaction-fee budget.
    * Added compatibility with nVesion=1 transactions. This is for possible
      future Bitcoin compatibility only, as it is exceedingly unlikely that
      these could ever see use on the Freicoin network.
    * Modified the transaction-generating code to take the reference height as
      a parameter, falling back on nBestHeight if it is not specified. The
      user-interface code currently passes nBestHeight without exposing
      refheight-setting functionality.
    * Examined failing tests and fixed some, removed the others that were
      specific to Bitcoin. `test_freicoin` now executes without error.
    * Created gitian release scripts for generated Linux, Windows zip, and
      Windows installer packages.
    * Updated vagrant-based gitian build process to work with new 0.7.x
      branch.
    * Black-listed updates to grub in vagrant host-vm creation script, as it
      was causing the build process to halt.

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta3~precise2) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Created new genesis block and magic byte protocol headers for beta3
      release.
    * Implemented subsidy of charitable causes via the Freicoin Foundation,
      with a 4:1 split of the initial distribution to addresses held in escrow
      for future disbursement.
    * Lowered the monetary base to 16 digits of precision, so that amounts may
      be tracked with accuracy of a single satoshi using the decimal64 type.
    * Fixed bug where allowed coin generation values were not being compared
      at the same reference height. Due to the way Freicoin works, if
      encountered this would have only resulted in a block claiming less coins
      than it could have if it has used the correct reference height.
    * Fixed time-traveller attack, courtesy of Art Fortz.
    * Added 2nd DNS and IP seed node provided by @galambo; corrected DNS entry
      for existing seed node.

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta2~precise3) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Merged with upstream commit 485d667 from the Bitcoin source tree, just a
      few commits post-v0.7.1.
    * Updated DNS and IP seed lists to match current configuration.
    * Changed ClientConnectInputs API to no longer require nBlockHeight has a
      parameter.
    * Fix instances where balances were being calculated incorrectly, and
      restructured the balance code to be able to get balances as-of a
      specified reference block height.

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta2~precise2) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Rebuilt genesis block using new transaction format (32-bit RefHeight
      instead of 64-bit), new initial block value, and new timestamp+nonce.
    * Switch to GCC 4.4.3 for Linux builds.
    * Now builds Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (lucid) packages on Ubuntu PPA.
    * Switched MPFR_ rounding constants to GMP_, for compatibility with MPFR
      2.x, for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS compatibility.
    * Switch glibc version from 2.11.1 to 2.11, for maximum compatibility.
    * Fixed choice of API for accessing Qt image data, which was an issue
      causing the Launchpad PPA to choke while building for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
      (lucid) which includes Qt 4.6.2.
    * Fixed inaccurate representation of balances in command-line API. The
      GetAmounts() and GetAccountAmounts() wallet APIs changed in the most
      recent demurrage payback implementation, but calls to these functions
      were not updated to reflect the changes.
    * Added documentation and checks to the inclusion of "height" to
      getmemorypool.
    * Corrected monetary base magic number from 21MM to 10bn, not 21MM.
    * Change testnet protocol-header to be derived from mainnet in the same
      way as for bitcoin/bitcoin_testnet.
    * Change transaction debits/credits and other related values to be
      displayed relative to the reference height of the transaction in the Qt
      client.
    * Print the reference height as part of the detailed description of the
      transaction.
    * Added refheight field to the return value of ListTransactions() and the
      gettransaction RPC.
    * Peg amounts returned by ListTransactions() and get transaction RPC to
      the reference height of the transaction.
    * GetCredit() is supposed to take absolute height, not relative depth as
      third parameter.
    * Added a python script to calculate demurrage parameters for the
      arithmetic progression algorithm.
    * Added nRefHeight to class CAccountingEntry, and add nBlockHeight
      parameter to GetAccountCreditDebit(). (Backwards-incompatible with
      existing wallets.)
    * Added "refheight" field to output of AcentryToJSON().
    * Change nRefHeight in version=2 transactions to be 32-bit instead of 64-
      bit. Requires new genesis block.
    * Switched coinbase distribution to arithmetic progression. This will be a
      test for the second beta, with the option kept to revert before final
      release. A new genesis block still needs to be created.
    * Explicitly set genesis block's nVersion field to 2, for clarity.
    * Increased size of “About Freicoin-Qt” dialog box, to account for extra
      copyright line.
    * Added “Ref-height” column to “Transactions” tab, showing the reference
      height for the transaction, with a field for restricting transactions
      based on a specified minimum height value.
    * Added script to find genesis block.

  [ Roman Mindalev ]
    * Update port number (8333 -> 8639) in documentation and tests.
